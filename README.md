# Commands / Steps to run the app: 
- Create your own database.yml in config folder connected to a postgreSQL database and a MySQL database
- Create your own application.yml file in config folder containing all the needed API keys. You can also contact me to get mine to test it out
- Inside your MySQL database, create the database specified in your database.yml
- Run the following commands: 
1) rake final:setup (this will do everything: dropping the database, recreating the database, migrate the database, seed the database with fake data and feed the datawarehouse with data from the MySQL database)
